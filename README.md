## How It's Made

Our project revolves around creating a secure, verifiable, and cross-chain invitation system for decentralized applications (DApps). We've integrated captcha authentication with attestation mechanisms to ensure both security against bots and verifiable user relationships. Here's how we built it:

#### Chain A Implementation
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Inviter
    participant Client
    participant SmartContract
    participant SignProtocol
    participant CCIP
    participant TargetChain

    Inviter ->> Client: Select DApps ID and call the createInvitation function
    Client ->> SmartContract: Execute the createInvitation function
    SmartContract ->> SignProtocol: Request to create attestation
    SignProtocol -->> SmartContract: Return attestation ID
    SmartContract ->> CCIP: Execute send function<br>(attestation ID, signature, wallet address, DApps ID)
    CCIP ->> TargetChain: Send data via CCIPsend
    TargetChain -->> Client: Return success response
```

### Chain B Implementation
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CCIP
    participant SignProtocolContract
    participant SmartContract
    participant Client
    participant Invitee
    
    
    CCIP ->> SmartContract: Receive Cross-Chain message from the chain A
    SmartContract ->> SmartContract: Verify Inviter's Signature
    SmartContract„ÄÄ->> SmartContract:Store invitation data
    Invitee ->> Client:Connect Wallet„ÄÅPass the Capthca authentication
    Our Wallet ->> Client: Generate Signature of captcha authentication
    Client ->> SmartContract: Call approveInvitation function
    SmartContract„ÄÄ->> SignProtocolContract: Create invitee attestation
    SignProtocol ->> SchemaHook : Verify the invitee's signature and captcha authentication
    SignProtocolContract ->> Client: Return Invitee attestation ID
```

### Overall Invitation Flow

#### 1. Inviter Creates and Sends Invitation Across Chains

1.1 Cross-Chain Invitation Creation: 
Invitors can generate invitations to DApps on our protocol that are valid across multiple blockchain networks.

1.2 Attestation via Sign Protocol: When creating an invitation, an attestation is generated using the Sign Protocol. This allows anyone to verify the validity of the invitation.
1.3 Transmission Using CCIP: Invitations are sent to any desired blockchain network via Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), providing flexibility and broad reach.

#### 2. Invitee Performs Captcha Verification and Accepts Invitation

2.1 Captcha Authentication: Invitees complete a captcha verification on our application to confirm they are not bots.
2.2 Access Token Verification and Signing: The application verifies the access token and signs it using our private key.
2.3 Invitation Acceptance: The invitee inputs the inviter's address, signs the transaction, and accepts the invitation.

#### 3. Contract Verifies Signatures and Captcha, Then Creates Attestation

3.1 Verification with Sign Protocol's Schema Hook: We use the Schema Hook feature of the Sign Protocol to verify both the invitee's signature and the captcha authentication signature within the smart contract.
3.2 Universal Verification Logic: By employing the Schema Hook, any attestation‚Äîeven those created outside our contract‚Äîruns the same verification logic, enhancing the attestation's validity.
3.3 Attestation Creation: An attestation is only generated when both signatures are successfully verified, ensuring security and trustworthiness.

#### 4. DApps Verify Attestation and Distribute Rewards
4.1 Attestation Verification: DApps can verify the attestations created by both the inviter and the invitee.
4.2 Signature Validation: Since the attestation contains signatures, anyone can validate its authenticity.
4.3 Reward Distribution: Once all attestations are verified, DApps distribute rewards to both the inviter and the invitee as an incentive for participation.


## Notable Technologies and Innovations

### 1. Cross-Chain Invitation & Captcha Attestation

**Enhanced Bot Prevention**
By combining captcha authentication with the Sign Protocol's attestation, we provide robust protection against bots.
**Trustworthy Attestations for Other Protocols**
If the captcha signer is trusted, these attestations can be utilized by other protocols, extending the utility beyond our system.
**Verifiable Inviter-Invitee Relationship**
We establish a verifiable relationship between the inviter and invitee, which other protocols can leverage securely.
### 2. Invitation Design Using CCIP
**On-Chain Cross-Chain Verification**
Utilizing CCIP, we've constructed an invitation mechanism that is both on-chain and verifiable across different blockchain networks.
**Trust-Minimized Approach for DApps**
DApps can overcome cross-chain barriers in a trust-minimized manner, allowing them to reach and engage with a larger user base effectively.

### Technical Highlights
**Integration with Sign Protocol**
The use of the Sign Protocol ensures that all invitations and acceptances are securely attested and verifiable.
**Schema Hook Utilization**
By implementing the Schema Hook, we maintain consistent verification logic across various contracts, bolstering security and validity.
**Cross-Chain Interoperability via CCIP**
CCIP enables seamless communication and invitation transmission across multiple blockchains, enhancing accessibility and user engagement.

----------------------------
By integrating these technologies, we've developed a system that not only secures against bot interactions but also creates verifiable relationships between users that can be trusted and utilized by the broader blockchain community. Our approach facilitates a more connected and secure ecosystem, allowing DApps to expand their reach across chains without compromising on trust or security.
